# Game-Theory-Fox-and-Holes

This repository contains all the code used to analyse the **Fox and Holes game** studied in the accompanying report. 
All figures appearing in the report were generated using the Python scripts of this repository. 

We approached this game using three different methods:

1. A farmer picking a random hole each day, and a fox hiding randomly in adjacent holes.

2. A farmer picking a specific hole each day using the double-sweep strategy, with a randomly moving fox.

3. A farmer using the double-sweep strategy, and a smart fox responding strategically.


## Usage
The scripts in are **independent**. 
Each one produces a specific figure or simulation related to the game.

You may adjust the parameters:

- `n` — number of holes.
- `N` — number of simulated plays of the game. 

to reproduce or extend the results.
